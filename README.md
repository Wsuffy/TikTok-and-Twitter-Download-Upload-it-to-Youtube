#TikTok-and-Twitter-Download-Upload-it-to-Youtube
Project Description:

This GitHub project is an application that simplifies the process of downloading TikTok and Twitter videos with just one click, and then uploading them to YouTube.

To download a video, you can easily paste the video link into the application. It will fetch the video from TikTok or Twitter and save it to your local device.

To upload videos to YouTube, you need to provide your YouTube account login and password, as well as the account ID in the format "channel/UC2YGn25vR2KbGO0hOimIWZQ" (where "UC2YGn25vR2KbGO0hOimIWZQ" is an example account ID). Please ensure that you have disabled two-factor authentication (2FA) for your YouTube account and set the language to English in your Google Account settings.

If you have recently created your YouTube account, you may need to navigate through certain pop-ups such as enabling dark theme and dismissing welcome greetings specific to YouTube. The application will guide you through this process.

Additionally, the application provides a loading history feature that logs the progress of your uploads in a JSON file, presenting it in a visually appealing manner for easy reference.

Overall, this GitHub project aims to simplify the download of TikTok and Twitter videos and streamline the uploading process to YouTube, ensuring a seamless experience for users.
